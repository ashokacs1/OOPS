        "1. **Encapsulation**\n",
        "2. **Inheritance**\n",
        "3. **Polymorphism**\n",
        "4. **Abstraction**\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Encapsulation\n",
        "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data. Access to the data can be controlled using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Inheritance\n",
        "Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (the child or derived class) inherits the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (the parent or base class). This allows for code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes. The derived class can also override or extend the functionality of the base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Polymorphism\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions. The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation. Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Abstraction\n",
        "Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It simplifies the design by allowing the programmer to focus on interactions at a higher level. Abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction in OOP."
